It may be removed without notice in a future version. The property was never a reliable indicator of the selector that could be used to obtain the set of elements currently contained in the jQuery set where it was a property, since subsequent traversal methods may have changed the set. Plugins that need to use a selector should have the caller pass in the selector as part of the plugin's arguments during initialization.</p>\n  "}]}
